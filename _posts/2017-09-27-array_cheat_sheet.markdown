Early on in my coding journey, I found remembering all of the array commands pretty challenging. So I thought I'd put together a cheat sheet for anyone who is going through the same thing or anyone who just needs an quick reference. 
I found an excellent source on this so I'll link that below!

Remember that if you want the transformations to be reflected in the return value, use map or collect. If you want to return the original value, use each.
