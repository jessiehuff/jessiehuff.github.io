title:  "All for the Grand “Why?”"

I read once that man can face any “how” as long as there is a “why.” So, when you dig deeper into my why with software development, it is all rooted in my love of creating. There is an inherent beauty in using thoughts you have, skills that you’ve honed, experiences you’ve endured to build something. I think when you pull up the roots of my reasoning, it all comes down to that. Of course, if you’d like me to elaborate on the fluffy side of that, I’d tell you that I dream of making the world a better place, of using everything I have to offer to help make a dark world a little brighter. But I’m a millennial so I’ve been told that dreaming of making a difference supposedly comes with the territory.

On a more practical note, there is an absolute need for developers right now. I think everyone is aware at this point that we’re continuing to advance technologically and the need to work within these new parameters. My degree was in International Business, concentrations in Marketing, Spanish, and Chinese. (I am an avid traveler and fascinated by language and culture. If you need any destination recommendations, I’m your girl!) Having studied the market and through my experience as the Director of Marketing for an automotive warehouse distributor, I’ve realized that to be successful in the market, there needs to be a balance in the art of people and the art of technology. I recognize that in order to keep improving my effectiveness in the market, I need to improve my technological expertise. So, I’ve carved out some time to really work on the mesmerizing art of programming. When I was young, I was fascinated by the idea of software development, but I mistakenly believed it was entirely analytical. It wasn’t until I’d played with different programming languages post-college that I realized how creative it really can be. It’s both analytical and creative- right up my alley.

Enter Flatiron School, stage right. 
I was beyond excited to start my programming journey since I’m a complete nerd. I get my jollies by learning new things and programming was just the medicine I needed. That’s not to say that it hasn’t been challenging. My goodness is it difficult most days. This is how I usually feel:

There’s something empowering though about struggling through challenging problems, learning a whole new way of thinking and problem solving. While most days are filled with staring at my computer in a stupor and wondering if I have coffee in my veins now instead of blood after the millionth cup, it’s incredibly rewarding to finally figure out a frustrating problem. I think why is a huge problem that we face as developers. Why doesn’t this code work? Why does it work now? Why did I stare at a screen for hours just to realize the mistake was a simple typo? At the end of the day though, I think it all comes down to creating something beautiful. While simple, writing beautiful code is a science and an art.
