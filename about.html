<p>I consider myself a Renaissance woman, addicted to knowledge and driven to continually develop myself. My heart and passion is one of my greatest strengths, and it is my lifeâ€™s mission to leave this world better than the way I found it in any way that I possibly can. </p>

<p>I have a vivid imagination which has led me to bring my thoughts to life in a multitude of outlets- writing, drawing, painting, music. My favorite has always been writing as I could build entire worlds with words alone. I began writing my first novel at 15, and I finally had it published at 18. I view myself as a creator, but traveling is a passion of mine as it gives me new perspective and fuel for my imagination. I am addicted to challenges, and I love to push myself to improve. Difficulty and obstacles only spark my drive to overcome, and that very mindset is also what has led me to enjoy yoga in my free time. I strive to always improve myself mentally, emotionally, and physically, and to use anything I have to offer to better the world around me.</p>

<p>Stick around if your curiosity has you asking for more.
